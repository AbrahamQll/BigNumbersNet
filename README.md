# BigNumbersNet
A simple library to calculate really big numbers operations in Csharp

### Is it trustable?
Absolutely not. This library has not been mathematically tested, and it is very much possible that it might contain some bugs. I have however ran some automated random testing, and it never showed any bugs.
You can run some tests if you are considering working on this, or expanding it, but I personally would not suggest using this in a production environment, only production perhaps.

### Any reports on memory usage?
Not yet! But perhaps you can simply use VS 2019 community profiler to be sure it meets your memory use requirements.

### Is it fast enough?
C# is not C++ or C or machine code. It runs in a virtual machine, using Microsoft (R) IL. With that being said, even then a calculation of adding two digits each having thousands of numbers took only about 5 ms - 9 ms.

### Any future plans expanding this?
Of course. It is nice to work on this, to make it a giant library that also supports different bases, and also other arithmetic operations. But it takes time. And right now I am working on some other projects.

### Can I use it?
Absolutely. Please feel free to do what ever you want to the code. But it would be nice if you could link back to this page if you liked to do the right thing. :) In the meantime you have to keep in mind that I can not grantee the safety of this code and it is provided AS IS, with no support or guarantee whatsoever. Use it on your own please.
